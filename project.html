    <h3>What I did:</h3>
    <span>We used the React javascript library to create a website for online book buying. Distributed tasks for each member of the group.</span>
    <h3>What I enjoyed:</h3>
    <span>I liked creating and customizing pages in React.</span>
    <h3>What I found difficult:</h3>
    <span>It was difficult to understand(React) and how to use it correctly.</span>
    <h3>What really worked:</h3>
    <span>A list of books, a page with a detailed description of the book, a login and registration page, and an order page. I think it's done well.</span>
    <h3>Next time:</h3>
    <span>Next time I will try other ways to create the table and login page.</span>
